# Branching

A branch is just a 40 byte reference to a commit. Branches are transitory (commits are not). Branches can be local or remote references.

A branch nails down part of a graph that you might want to go back to later, its just a new pointer. 

Remotes are just pointers to other people's graphs. Cloning a repo adds a pointer to 'origin' by default. You can rename this.
